### [LIVE DEMO](https://www.a-gardner.com/)

## Description
This is my website CV that was forked from [https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template), I made some modifications and adjustments and this was primarily to familiarize myself with ReactJS structure. A big thanks to the [original author](https://github.com/tbakerx) and to all the other contributors of the main template.

#### About [`particles-bg`](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg) Library
##### This project uses the react particle background component library [https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg](https://github.com/lindelof/particles-bg). 


#### Local Troubleshooting
- Running yarn install should install the dependencies, however react has had issues with node versions >= 17. Use node 16.19.0 to resolve this.
- To run this website locally use `yarn run start`
