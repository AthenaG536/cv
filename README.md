## Description
This is my website CV that was forked from [https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template](https://github.com/tbakerx/react-resume-template), I made some modifications and adjustments and this was primarily to familiarize myself with ReactJS structure. A big thanks to the [original author](https://github.com/tbakerx) and to all the other contributors of the main template.
